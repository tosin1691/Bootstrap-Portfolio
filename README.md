I used Bootstap components to recreate my web portfolio page (see screenshot about) with the following criteria in mind:

1) The webpage includes:

- A Navigation bar
    
    - A navigation menu at the top. 

      - Include links that are applicable to my portfolio.
  
        - Links navigates to the appropriate sections 

    - A hero section

        - A jumbotron featuring my picture, name, and job title.

    - A work section

      - A section displaying my portfolio of work in grid. 

      - Utilised bootstrap cards for each project.

        - The description gives a brief overview of the work.

      - Each project links to my work!

    - A skills section that list out the skills I expect to learn from the bootcamp.

    - An about / contact section in the same row.
    
    - A footer section
     
    - All hyperlinks have a hover effect.

    - All buttons displays a box shadow upon hover.


2) The Bootstrap solution minimized the use of media queries (Only one was used).

The "About me" section provides users with a background on the developer.
